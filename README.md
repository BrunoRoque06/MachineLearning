# Machine Learning

This repository contains the following algorithms of machine learning:
* __Linear Regression__, for one or more variables, using gradient descent and feature normalization;
* __Logistic Regression__, using "fminunc" function instead of gradient descent;
* __Multiclass Classification and Neural Networks__, one vs all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand written digits;
* __Neural Networks Learning__, feedforward and backpropagation applied on neural networks, again on hand written digit recognition;
* __Regularized Linear Regression and Bias__, use of linear regression to study models with different bias/variance properties;
* __Support Vector Machines__, email spam classifier;
* __Kmeans Clustering__, centroid estimation, used to compress an image;
* __Anomaly Detection__, detection of server failures on a network.

Every folder has a `.pdf` describing each algorithm. Matlab R2016a was used.
